Perl6 Net Pack

A collection of modules for Perl 6 aiming providing network-related
infrastructure.  This will tend towards the same direction as the
Perl5 "Frame" module sets, and roll in a lot of the functionality
of Perl5 modules such as Net::Address::*, but refactoring to
fully utilize the polymorphic REPR/parameterized Role/multidispatch
feature sets of Perl6.

The only thing here right now is a grammar for safe parsing of textual
representation of IPv4 addresses.

Right now I'm tracking Rakudo star and once niecza has a few more
items on its tick list I will attempt to keep these modules compatible
with niecza monthly binary releases as well.  Standard tuit disclaimers
apply.

I'm trying for "distribution quality" as far as packaging/docs/API
and so am happy to take any advice towards that end.

Everything here is released under Perl Artistic License, natch.
